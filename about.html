      <p>I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Currently I reside in Stittsville with my family. I went to Sacred Heart Catholic High School and graduated in 2017. I currently go to Algonquin College for Interactive Media Design, such as learning how to design websites, make videos and photos, UX design, graphic design, and more to come in the future. I also took Computer Programming and Computer Systems Technician in the past. I learned languages such as Java and SQL. I was also taught Operating Systems, such as Linux and Windows in Computer Systems Technician along with basic networking</p>

      <p>Outside of school and work, I have many hobbies that I like to do. I like to play music, both by listening and playing. Some of my favourite bands are Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, and my favourite genre would have to be Heavy Metal or Progressive Rock. I play guitar in my free time and like to learn songs on it or even make my own songs, which helps with my creativity and brain activity. Some physical hobbies that I also like to do would be skiing and skating, and play hockey on the outdoor rink with my friends. I also like to bike along the Trans Canada Trail on really nice hot summer days and explore nature.</p>

      <p>Throughout my work history, I have held a variety of part-time jobs. My first part time job was at Saunders Farm as a dishwasher. I worked there from 2014-2016. My second job was at Independent in Stittsville. I worked as a shelf stocker and worked in HMR, where you deep fry food. I had that job from 2016-2019. Right now, I currently work at Value Village as a CDC
      Ambassador. I basically just collect donations from the general public and put them on carts.</p>

      <p>One achievement I got was top mark in Computer Programming in Grade 12. My mark when I got the top mark was an 88, and the language we learned was Java, which I would later learn at Algonquin. I'm also proud of my GPA in Semester 1 of Interactive Media Design, I held a 3.61 GPA in that semester, and was my best GPA that I have ever gotten throughout my education.</p>
