# How I made this site

I made this site using bootstrap for the most part. And if I wanted to change a file, I would just edit the styles on the tag.

## Problems I overcame

One problem I faced was the general layout of the site. Another problem was trying to post to github.

## How I overcame these problems

I asked my classmate Andrea for help, she was very helpful. I also did lots of research and it helped solved my problems.
