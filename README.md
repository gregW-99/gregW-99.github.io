# How I made this site

I made this site using bootstrap for the most part. And if I wanted to change a file, I would just edit the styles on the tag. I used the incomplete prototype file to guide me through the layout, but added colour to it to make it look more life like. 

## Problems I overcame

One problem I faced was the general layout of the site. Another problem was trying to post to github.

## How I overcame these problems

I asked my classmate Andrea for help, she was very helpful. I also did lots of research and it helped solved my problems. It was a lot of work to really figure out these problems but I'm glad that they all got sorted out. I never thought that I would figure this all out.

## What I have learned

I've learned that bootstrap is a really nice way to quickly make a website using code. It's really useful if you need to get something done in a hurry and I'm glad that bootstrap was made for that.
